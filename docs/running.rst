Running cog
===========

Cog is a command-line utility which takes arguments in standard form.

.. {{{cog
    # Re-run this with `make cogdoc`
    # Here we use unconventional markers so the docs can use [[[ without
    # getting tangled up in the cog processing.

    import io
    import textwrap
    from cogapp import Cog

    print("\n.. code-block:: text\n")
    outf = io.StringIO()
    print("$ cog -h", file=outf)
    cog = Cog()
    cog.set_output(stdout=outf, stderr=outf)
    cog.main(["cog", "-h"])
    print(textwrap.indent(outf.getvalue(), "    "))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: text

    $ cog -h
    cog - generate content with inlined Python code.

    cog [OPTIONS] [INFILE | @FILELIST | &FILELIST] ...

    INFILE is the name of an input file, '-' will read from stdin.
    FILELIST is the name of a text file containing file names or
    other @FILELISTs.

    For @FILELIST, paths in the file list are relative to the working
    directory where cog was called.  For &FILELIST, paths in the file
    list are relative to the file list location.

    OPTIONS:
        -c          Checksum the output to protect it against accidental change.
        -d          Delete the generator code from the output file.
        -D name=val Define a global string available to your generator code.
        -e          Warn if a file has no cog code in it.
        -I PATH     Add PATH to the list of directories for data files and modules.
        -n ENCODING Use ENCODING when reading and writing files.
        -o OUTNAME  Write the output to OUTNAME.
        -p PROLOGUE Prepend the generator source with PROLOGUE. Useful to insert an
                    import line. Example: -p "import math"
        -P          Use print() instead of cog.outl() for code output.
        -r          Replace the input file with the output.
        -s STRING   Suffix all generated output lines with STRING.
        -U          Write the output with Unix newlines (only LF line-endings).
        -w CMD      Use CMD if the output file needs to be made writable.
                        A %s in the CMD will be filled with the filename.
        -x          Excise all the generated output without running the generators.
        -z          The end-output marker can be omitted, and is assumed at eof.
        -v          Print the version of cog and exit.
        --check     Check that the files would not change if run again.
        --markers='START END END-OUTPUT'
                    The patterns surrounding cog inline instructions. Should
                    include three values separated by spaces, the start, end,
                    and end-output markers. Defaults to '[[[cog ]]] [[[end]]]'.
        --verbosity=VERBOSITY
                    Control the amount of output. 2 (the default) lists all files,
                    1 lists only changed files, 0 lists no files.
        -h          Print this help.

In addition to running cog as a command on the command line, you can also
invoke it as a module with the Python interpreter:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 -m cogapp [options] [arguments]

Note that the Python module is called "cogapp".


Input files
-----------

Files on the command line are processed as input files. All input files are
assumed to be UTF-8 encoded. Using a minus for a filename (``-``) will read the
standard input.

Files can also be listed in a text file named on the command line
with an ``@``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cog @files_to_cog.txt

File names in the list file are relative to the current directory. You can also
use ``&files_to_cog.txt`` and the file names will be relative to the location
of the list file.

These list files can be nested, and each line can contain switches as well as a
file to process.  For example, you can create a file cogfiles.txt:

.. code-block:: text

    # These are the files I run through cog
    mycode.cpp
    myothercode.cpp
    myschema.sql -s " --**cogged**"
    readme.txt -s ""

then invoke cog like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cog -s " //**cogged**" @cogfiles.txt

Now cog will process four files, using C++ syntax for markers on all the C++
files, SQL syntax for the .sql file, and no markers at all on the readme.txt
file.

As another example, cogfiles2.txt could be:

.. code-block:: text

    template.h -D thefile=data1.xml -o data1.h
    template.h -D thefile=data2.xml -o data2.h

with cog invoked like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cog -D version=3.4.1 @cogfiles2.txt

Cog will process template.h twice, creating both data1.h and data2.h.  Both
executions would define the variable version as "3.4.1", but the first run
would have thefile equal to "data1.xml" and the second run would have thefile
equal to "data2.xml".


Overwriting files
-----------------

The ``-r`` flag tells cog to write the output back to the input file.  If the
input file is not writable (for example, because it has not been checked out of
a source control system), a command to make the file writable can be provided
with ``-w``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cog -r -w "p4 edit %s" @files_to_cog.txt


Setting globals
---------------

Global values can be set from the command line with the ``-D`` flag.  For
example, invoking Cog like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cog -D thefile=fooey.xml mycode.txt

will run Cog over mycode.txt, but first define a global variable called thefile
with a value of "fooey.xml". This variable can then be referenced in your
generator code. You can provide multiple ``-D`` arguments on the command line,
and all will be defined and available.

The value is always interpreted as a Python string, to simplify the problem of
quoting.  This means that:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cog -D NUM_TO_DO=12

will define ``NUM_TO_DO`` not as the integer ``12``, but as the string
``"12"``, which are different and not equal values in Python. Use
`int(NUM_TO_DO)` to get the numeric value.


Checksummed output
------------------

If cog is run with the ``-c`` flag, then generated output is accompanied by
a checksum:

.. code-block:: sql

    --[[[cog
    --   import cog
    --   for i in range(10):
    --      cog.out("%d " % i)
    --]]]
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    --[[[end]]] (checksum: bd7715304529f66c4d3493e786bb0f1f)

If the generated code is edited by a misguided developer, the next time cog
is run, the checksum won't match, and cog will stop to avoid overwriting the
edited code.


Continuous integration
----------------------

You can use the ``--check`` option to run cog just to check that the files
would not change if run again.  This is useful in continuous integration to
check that your files have been updated properly.


Output line suffixes
--------------------

To make it easier to identify generated lines when grepping your source files,
the ``-s`` switch provides a suffix which is appended to every non-blank text
line generated by Cog.  For example, with this input file (mycode.txt):

.. code-block:: text

    [[[cog
    cog.outl('Three times:\n')
    for i in range(3):
        cog.outl('This is line %d' % i)
    ]]]
    [[[end]]]

invoking cog like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cog -s " //(generated)" mycode.txt

will produce this output:

.. code-block:: text

    [[[cog
    cog.outl('Three times:\n')
    for i in range(3):
        cog.outl('This is line %d' % i)
    ]]]
    Three times: //(generated)

    This is line 0 //(generated)
    This is line 1 //(generated)
    This is line 2 //(generated)
    [[[end]]]


Miscellaneous
-------------

The ``-n`` option lets you tell cog what encoding to use when reading and
writing files.

The ``--verbose`` option lets you control how much cog should chatter about the
files it is cogging.  ``--verbose=2`` is the default: cog will name every file
it considers, and whether it has changed.  ``--verbose=1`` will only name the
changed files. ``--verbose=0`` won't mention any files at all.

The ``--markers`` option lets you control the syntax of the marker lines.  The
value must be a string with two spaces in it.  The three markers are the three
pieces separated by the spaces.  The default value for markers is ``"[[[cog ]]]
[[[end]]]"``.

The ``-x`` flag tells cog to delete the old generated output without running
the generators.  This lets you remove all the generated output from a source
file.

The ``-d`` flag tells cog to delete the generators from the output file.  This
lets you generate content in a public file but not have to show the generator
to your customers.

The ``-U`` flag causes the output file to use pure Unix newlines rather than
the platform's native line endings.  You can use this on Windows to produce
Unix-style output files.

The ``-I`` flag adds a directory to the path used to find Python modules.

The ``-p`` option specifies Python text to prepend to embedded generator
source, which can keep common imports out of source files.

The ``-z`` flag lets you omit the ``[[[end]]]`` marker line, and it will be
assumed at the end of the file.
